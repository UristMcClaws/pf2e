Otherwise, you must use a ranged Strike. An army can attempt a maximum of 5 ranged Strikes per war encounter (unless it has the Increased Ammunition tactic). As with any attack, multiple Strikes in a single round suffer a multiple attack penalty.$ A siege engine can use the Battle action to attack and damage a fortification.
